**IBM Z**<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> is a family name used by [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") for all of its [z/Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/Architecture "Z/Architecture") [mainframe computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer "Mainframe computer"). In July 2017, with another generation of products, the official family was changed to IBM Z from IBM z Systems; the IBM Z family now includes the newest model, the IBM z16, as well as the z15, the z14, and the z13 (released under the IBM z Systems/IBM System z names), the IBM zEnterprise models (in common use the zEC12 and z196), the [IBM System z10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z10 "IBM System z10") models (in common use the z10 EC), the [IBM System z9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z9 "IBM System z9") models (in common use the z9EC) and _IBM eServer zSeries_ models (in common use refers only to the z900 and z990 generations of mainframe).

The _zSeries,_ _zEnterprise,_ _System z_ and _IBM Z_ families were named for their availability – _z_ stands for [zero downtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability "High availability"). The systems are built with spare components capable of hot [failovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover "Failover") to ensure continuous operations.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

The IBM Z family maintains full [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility"). In effect, current systems are the direct, lineal descendants of the [System/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System/360 "System/360"), announced in 1964, and the [System/370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System/370 "System/370") from the 1970s. Many applications written for these systems can still run unmodified on the newest IBM Z system.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

[Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization "Virtualization") is required by default on IBM Z systems. First layer virtualization is provided by the Processor Resource and System Manager (PR/SM) to deploy one or more Logical Partitions ([LPARs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPAR "LPAR")). Each LPAR supports a variety of operating systems. A [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor "Hypervisor") called [z/VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/VM "Z/VM") can also be run as the second layer virtualization in LPARs to create as many [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual machine") (VMs) as there are resources assigned to the LPARs to support them. The first layer of IBM Z virtualization (PR/SM) allows a z machine to run a limited number of LPARs (up to 80 on the IBM z13). These can be considered virtual "bare metal" servers because PR/SM allows CPUs to be dedicated to individual LPARs. z/VM LPARs allocated within PR/SM LPARs can run a very large number of virtual machines as long as there are adequate CPU, memory, and I/O resources configured with the system for the desired performance, capacity, and throughput.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

IBM Z's PR/SM and hardware attributes allow compute resources to be dynamically changed to meet workload demands. CPU and memory resources can be non-disruptively added to the system and dynamically assigned, recognized, and used by LPARs. I/O resources such as IP and SAN ports can also be added dynamically. They are virtualized and shared across all LPARs. The hardware component that provides this capability is called the Channel Subsystem. Each LPAR can be configured to either "see" or "not see" the virtualized I/O ports to establish desired "shareness" or isolation. This virtualization capability allows significant reduction in I/O resources because of its ability to share them and drive up utilization.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

PR/SM on IBM Z has earned [Common Criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria "Common Criteria") [Evaluation Assurance Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_Assurance_Level "Evaluation Assurance Level") (EAL) 5+ security certification,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> and z/VM has earned Common Criteria EAL4+ certification.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

The [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine "Kernel-based Virtual Machine") hypervisor from [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") has also been ported.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>

#### zEnterprise gen1 (114 and 196)

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_Z&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: zEnterprise gen1 (114 and 196)")\]

zEnterprise, announced in July 2010, with the z196 model, was designed to offer both mainframe and distributed server technologies in an integrated system. The zEnterprise System consists of three components:<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup>

-   First is a System z server.
-   Second is the IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX).
-   Last is the management layer, IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager (zManager), which provides a single management view of zEnterprise resources.

The zEnterprise is designed to extend mainframe capabilities – management efficiency, dynamic resource allocation, serviceability – to other systems and workloads running on AIX on POWER7, and Microsoft Windows or Linux on x86.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>

The zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) is an infrastructure component that hosts both general purpose [IBM BladeCenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_BladeCenter "IBM BladeCenter") servers and appliance-like workload optimizers which can all be managed as if they were a single mainframe. The zBX supports a private high speed internal network that connects it to the central processing complex, which reduces the need for networking hardware and provides inherently high security.

The IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager integrates the System z and zBX resources as a single virtualized system and provides unified and integrated management across the zEnterprise System. It can identify system bottlenecks or failures among disparate systems and if a failure occurs it can dynamically reallocate system resources to prevent or reduce application problems. The Unified Resource Manager provides energy monitoring and management, resource management, increased security, virtual networking, and information management from a single user interface.

> **zEnterprise 114** – The **z114** is a entry-level single-rack solution, available in two hardware models: M05 and M10. Introduced in July, 2011, this system is designed to extend the benefits of the zEnterprise System to the mid-range business segment. Like the z196, the z114 is fully compatible with the zBX and the URM and also features the mission-critical server design elements. The z114 features up to 14 cores (up to 10 configurable) with a clock speed of 3.8 GHz. The z114 is physically approximately half the size of the z196.

IBM System z10

This generation of Z servers supported more memory than previous generation systems and can have up to 64 central processors (CPs) per frame. The full speed z10 processor's uniprocessor performance was up to 62% faster than that of the z9 server, according to IBM's z10 announcement, and included these other features:

-   50% more performance and 70% more usable capacity. The new 4.4 GHz processor was designed to address CPU intensive workloads and support large scale server consolidation on the mainframe.
-   Just-in-time capacity and management – monitoring of multiple systems based on Capacity Provisioning and Workload Manager (WLM) definitions. When the defined conditions are met, z/OS can suggest capacity changes for manual activation from a z/OS console, or the system can add or remove temporary capacity automatically and without operator intervention.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup>

Specific models from this family include:

-   z10 Business Class (2098 series), introduced on October 21, 2008
-   z10 Enterprise Class (2097 series), introduced on February 26, 2008

IBM System z9

In July 2005, IBM announced a new family of servers – the [System z9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_z9 "System z9") family – with the IBM System z9 Enterprise Class (z9 EC) and the IBM System z9 Business Class (z9 BC) servers. The System z9 servers offered:

-   More flexibility on the enterprise class servers in customizing and sizing the capacity of the general purpose processors (CPs) that reside in the server. The z9 EC servers offered four different sub-capacity settings when run with eight or fewer general purpose processors.
-   [zIIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIIP "ZIIP") engines. The zIIP is designed so that a program can work with z/OS to have all or a portion of its [Service Request Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Request_Block "Service Request Block") (SRB) dispatched work directed to the zIIP to help free up capacity on the general purpose processor which may make it available for use by other workloads running on the server.
-   [MIDAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDAW "MIDAW"). The Modified Indirect Data Address Word (MIDAW) facility offers an alternative facility for a channel program to be constructed. It is designed to improve performance for native FICON applications that use extended format datasets (including DB2 and VSAM) by helping to improve channel utilization, reduce channel overhead, and improve I/O response times.
-   CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) is shipped on every CP and IFL processor in support of clear key encryption. CPACF was enhanced for System z9 processors to include support of the [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard") (AES) for 128-bit keys, Secure Hash Algorithm-256 (SHA-256), CPACF offers DES, Triple DES and SHA-1.

Specific models from this family include:

-   z9 Business Class (2096 series), successor to the z890 and smallest z990 models (2006)
-   z9 Enterprise Class (2094 series), introduced in 2005, initially as z9-109, beginning the new _System z9_ line

An IBM zSeries 800 (foreground, left) running Linux

Announced on October 3, 2000, and available on December 18, the [eServer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EServer "EServer") zSeries 900 (**z900** for short) was the first to feature the [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing "64-bit computing") **[z/Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/Architecture "Z/Architecture")** extension of the [S/360 architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_architecture "IBM System/360 architecture"), still retaining the support for the [31-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31-bit_computing#IBM_mainframes_with_31-bit_addressing "31-bit computing") and 24-bit [addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address") programs back to 1964.

The system's 12 or 20 _Blue Flame_<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> processors, of which up to 16 could be used as Central Processors, are contained in a [multi-chip module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-chip_module "Multi-chip module") with 101 glass-ceramic layers and 4226 I/O pins. Each processor has 47 million transistors across 177 mm<sup>2</sup>. Compared to the preceding S/390 G6, the Blue Flame's L1 cache is doubled by splitting it 256+256 KB I+D and the L2 cache is doubled to 32 MB. The peripheral I/O bandwidth has been tripled to 24 GB/s, while the main memory has the bandwidth of 70 GB/s, a 150 ns latency and up to 64 GB capacity.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> Featuring a 7-stage pipeline, the Blue Flame initially attained 769 MHz with a bulk 180 nm process, and upon the change to [silicon on insulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_on_insulator "Silicon on insulator") in May 2002 reached 917 MHz, at which it consumes 38 Watts.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 2002, IBM launched the **z800**, a lower-end mainframe featuring five Blue Flames clocked at 625 MHz, of which up to four can be Central Processors, all sharing an 8 MB L2 cache. The I/O bandwidth is 6 GB/s and the memory capacity is up to 32 GB.<sup id="cite_ref-z9-109_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-z9-109-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>

The fully redesigned **z990** mainframes for the mid-range and high-end became available in June and October 2003, respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Featuring IBM's first [superscalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscalar_processor "Superscalar processor") [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") mainframe processors, a dual-core chip contained 121 million transistors across 266 mm<sup>2</sup>, and was manufactured in a 130 nm process, drawing 55 Watts at 1.2 GHz in the z990.<sup id="cite_ref-z990cpu_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-z990cpu-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Each core contained a cryptographic coprocessor supporting the [Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard "Data Encryption Standard") and [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1 "SHA-1").<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-z990cpu_41-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-z990cpu-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup>

The z990 contained up to 48 cores, of which up to 32 were enabled as Central Processors. To support this increase, the z990 was the first IBM mainframe with a [non-uniform memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access "Non-uniform memory access"), as its processors and memory were grouped into up to four "book"-modules, each book also containing a 32 MB L2 cache.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> It was also the first to be capable of speculative [memory disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_disambiguation "Memory disambiguation").<sup id="cite_ref-z990cpu_41-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-z990cpu-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> The maximum I/O bandwidth and memory capacity were both quadrupled, to 96 GB/s and 256 GB respectively, as was the number of [I/O channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_I/O "Channel I/O") through the introduction of the quad-_Logical Channel SubSystems_ (LCSS). Each instance of an OS can access no more than one LCSS, thus preserving the limit of 256 channels per an OS.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> The number of [logical partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_partition "Logical partition") was doubled to 30, and the maximum distance of [Parallel Sysplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Parallel_Sysplex "IBM Parallel Sysplex") rose to 100 km. It took some time for a single OS to fully utilize the z990, as the [z/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS "Z/OS") and [z/VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/VM "Z/VM") only gained support for 24 processors in September 2004, and for 32 processors in June 2005 for the z/OS and June 2007 for the z/VM.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup>

In May 2004, the z800 was succeeded by the **z890**. The memory capacity and the core count were left unchanged from the z800, but the processors were the same as in the z990 except clocked at 1.0 GHz. The L2 cache's size was 32 MB, and the I/O subsystem supported two LCSSs and 16 GB/s of bandwidth.<sup id="cite_ref-z9-109_39-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-z9-109-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 2004, IBM extended the idea of lower-cost restricted processors (first introduced in 2000 in the form of [IFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Facility_for_Linux "Integrated Facility for Linux"), for use by [Linux on IBM Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z "Linux on IBM Z") only) that are not permitted to run the traditional mainframe OSes ([z/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS "Z/OS"), [z/VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/VM "Z/VM"), [z/VSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/VSE "Z/VSE"), and [z/TPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/TPF "Z/TPF")), by the addition of [z Application Assist Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_Application_Assist_Processor "Z Application Assist Processor") dedicated to [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform) "Java (software platform)") and [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") processing. The IFL and zAAP are physically the same as the Central Processors, but IBM charges lower fees for their use. In 2006 another restricted processor type, the [z Integrated Information Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIIP "ZIIP"), was added in the [System z9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z9 "IBM System z9").

### Processors and memory

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_Z&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Processors and memory")\]

The IBM zSeries systems were based on the [z/Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/Architecture "Z/Architecture") chips – the [out-of-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution "Out-of-order execution") [CISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer "Complex instruction set computer")\-based [z/Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/Architecture "Z/Architecture") multi-core processors. The maximum number of cores available in a particular model of the zEC12 is denoted by the model name. For example, the H20 has up to 20 cores orderable for direct customer use, plus spare and a special I/O processor core type, the System Assist Processor. Each core can be characterized as a [Central Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_zEC12 "IBM zEC12") (CP), [Integrated Facility for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Facility_for_Linux "Integrated Facility for Linux") (IFL) processor, [z Application Assist Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_Application_Assist_Processor "Z Application Assist Processor") (zAAP), [z10 Integrated Information Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIIP "ZIIP") (zIIP), Internal [Coupling Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_Facility "Coupling Facility") (ICF) processor, or additional System Assist Processor (SAP).

A processor book is a modular card in [IBM mainframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_mainframe "IBM mainframe") that contains processors, memory, and I/O connections.<sup id="cite_ref-mainframe-redbook_47-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-mainframe-redbook-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> A multi-chip module is welded onto each processor book for the z196 model.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup>

#### The computing power ordering

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_Z&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: The computing power ordering")\]

The typical ordering process of modern IBM Z mainframe looks like a buying of service<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> or looks like a leasing;<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> the mainframe is a program/hardware complex with rent for a system workload, and (in the most cases) additional system capabilities can be unlocked after additional payment.

The z15, z14, z13, zEC12, zBC12, z114 and z196 support the IBM operating systems: [z/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS "Z/OS"), [z/VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/VM "Z/VM"), [z/VSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/VSE "Z/VSE"), and [z/TPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/TPF "Z/TPF"). Other operating systems available include [Linux on IBM Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z "Linux on IBM Z"), such as [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux "Red Hat Enterprise Linux") and [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Linux_Enterprise_Server "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server").<sup id="cite_ref-IBMSpecs_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-IBMSpecs-52"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup> In November, 2011, IBM introduced [Microsoft Windows Server 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_Server_2008 "Microsoft Windows Server 2008") support via [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86 "X86") processor-based [blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_blade "Server blade") that plug into IBM's zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX). The zBX also supports the IBM WebSphere DataPower Integrated Appliance XI50 for zEnterprise (DataPower XI50z).

### BladeCenter Extension (zBX)

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_Z&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: BladeCenter Extension (zBX)")\]

zBX extension

The zEnterprise System supports an optional **zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension** (zBX). This add-on infrastructure supports redundant top-of-Rack switches, redundant power supplies, extra blowers, and [IBM BladeCenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_BladeCenter "IBM BladeCenter") chassis. This add-on chassis allows [POWER7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER7 "POWER7") and [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86 "X86") [blade servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_servers "Blade servers") to be integrated with and managed from the mainframe.<sup id="cite_ref-ZDNet1_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-ZDNet1-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> A [gameframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameframe "Gameframe") installation at Hoplon Infotainment is an example of a hybrid mainframe.

The zBX supports up to 112 blade modules.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> The zBX and the System Z server are connected by a redundant, secure [10 Gigabit Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Gigabit_Ethernet "10 Gigabit Ethernet") connection, providing a private data network. There is also a [1 Gigabit Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet "Gigabit Ethernet") connection for management.

### Unified Resource Manager

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_Z&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Unified Resource Manager")\]

The zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager (zManager) allows the supported zBX platforms to be virtualized into a single system for management. It also allows for the prioritization of certain workloads in the system. The Resource Manager can monitor the various platforms for signs of bottlenecks or faults and modify the overall system to recover, maintaining a specified [quality of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service "Quality of service") level.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-55"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup>

The zEC12 and z196 support external liquid cooling. Customers have the option of purchasing their mainframe with a water-cooled heat exchanger.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Z#cite_note-56"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup>

### PU characterization

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_Z&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: PU characterization")\]

Each purchased PU (processor unit) is characterized as one of a variety of types:

-   **CP**: Central processor; The standard processors. For use with any supported operating system and user applications.
-   **IFL**: [Integrated Facility for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Facility_for_Linux "Integrated Facility for Linux"); Exploited by Linux and for z/VM processing in support of Linux. It is not possible to [IPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Program_Load "Initial Program Load") operating systems other than z/VM or Linux on an IFL.
-   **zAAP**: [Application Assist Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_Application_Assist_Processor "Z Application Assist Processor"); Exploited under z/OS for designated workloads, which include the IBM JVM and XML System Services functions.
-   **zIIP**: [Integrated Information Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIIP "ZIIP"); Exploited under z/OS for designated workloads, which include various XML System Services, IPSec offload, certain parts of IBM DB2 DRDA, star schema, IBM HiperSockets for large messages, and the IBM GBS Scalable Architecture for Financial Reporting.
-   **ICF**: [Internal Coupling Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_Facility "Coupling Facility"); Used for z/OS clustering, running exclusively the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC).
-   **SAP**: [System Assist Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_I/O "Channel I/O"); Offloads and manages I/O operations.
-   **IFP**: Integrated Firmware Processor; reserved for managing new generation of [PCIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCIe "PCIe") adapters in zEC12 and zBC12.
-   **Spares**: exclusively reserved to provide failover in the event of a processor (CP, IFL, zAAP, zIIP, ICF, SAP or IFP) failure.

Also it's possible to run a zAAP-eligible workload on zIIPs if no zAAPs are enabled. IBM does not impose any software charges on work that is dispatched on zAAP and zIIP processors.

The addition of IFLs, zAAPs, zIIPs, ICFs, SAPs or IFPs does not change the system capacity setting or its [MSU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_service_units "Million service units") rating, only CPs do.
